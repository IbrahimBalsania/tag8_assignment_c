You are a renowned hacker who has recently found a bug within Flipmart. For a given amount of time, you can steal items from their inventory. However, each inventory item has a price and takes up a specific time to be available. Make a function which returns the maximum value of the inventory that can be stolen.

Function Input Parameter: Time available to hack, Inventory array*
Function Output Parameter: Inventory Array combination with max cost
For example:
    - function name : hackFlipmart
    - Time available : 100 seconds
    - Total inventory available : 4 items
    - Time taken and value of each inventory :
    - Item 1 : 10 seconds : Rs. 50
    - Item 2 : 14 seconds : Rs. 100
    - Item 3 : 3 seconds : Rs. 20
    - Item 4 : 18 seconds : Rs. 150
    - This entire data can be represented as [[10,50], [14,100], [3,20], [18, 150]]
    - Also, ensure that you have taken fringe cases into consideration. Any item cannot have a zero price and time took also cannot be zero.
    - *Inventory Array is an array of items with time to be available and cost. for eg. [[10,50], [14,100], [3,20], [18, 150]]
